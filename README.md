Pi-OS
=====

Simple Raspberry Pi Operating System.

Following the tutorials [here](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/index.html) this is a very simple Raspberry Pi operating system written in ARMv6 Assembly language.

To use this OS, you will need to compile the code using the Yagarto GNU toolchain and simply replace the kernel.img file found on your Raspberry Pi SD card with the new kernel.img file generated by the compiler. 

Credit goes to Alex Chadwick for the tutorials and the template code.

Current status: Contents of 'cmdline' Linux Boot tag drawn to screen

I have left some older 'main.s' files in the repo for you to try if you wish. Simply pick the one you want and rename it to 'main.s' and remove the others. There's one that will flash a given morse code signal, one that will print some funky coloured lines to a screen, and one that prints out the contents on the 'cmdline' Linux Boot tag.
