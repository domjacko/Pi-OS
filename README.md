Pi-OS

Simple Raspberry Pi Operating System.

Following the tutorials [here](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/index.html) this is a very simple Raspberry Pi operating system written in ARMv6 Assembly language.

To use this OS, you will need to compile the code using the Yagarto GNU toolchain and simply replace the kernel.img file found on your Raspberry Pi SD card with the new kernel.img file generated by the compiler. 

Credit goes to Alex Chadwick for the tutorials and the template code.
